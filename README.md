# Monte Carlo Simulation
## Description:
In this Repo Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is used for calculating the cross section of coherent and incoherent scattering of photons. In addition to that MC was used to approximate the value of pi.

## Instructions:
Simply run the scripts to look at the plots.

MC_incoherent_scattering.py and MC_coherent_scatering.py will show the calculated cross section in comparison to the theroretical one.
MC_pi.py shows the relative error of the two methods of approximation of pi for a different number of iterations.
